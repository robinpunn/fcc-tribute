        <blockquote cite="https://relai.app/satoshi-nakamoto-quotes/">"A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system."<br> <br>--Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote>
